abstract = {This report is concerned with methods for solving the scattered data interpolation problem. A comparison of 29 methods for solution of this problem has been made. Each of the methods is discussed and the results of extensive testing for their properties and appropiate values of their parameters is given. Both local and global methods are considered. Comparisons of timing, storage, accuracy, visual pleasantness of the surface, and earse of implementation are made. A large number number (over 200) of pages of perpective plots of surfaces are given. Suggestions for improvement of some methods are made, and methods which have poor approximation properties are identified.},

@article{Tibshirani1996,
abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},
